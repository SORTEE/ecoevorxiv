# Submit preprints

EcoEvoRxiv provides a platform for researchers to share their research before formal peer review. By submitting a preprint, you can quickly disseminate your findings, receive early feedback, and enhance the visibility of your work. Our goal is to make the submission process as straightforward as possible, helping you engage with your peers and contribute to ongoing discussions in ecology and evolution.   

### Basic rules

EcoEvoRxiv welcomes preprints across all areas of ecology and evolution. Each submission undergoes a review process by our editorial team to ensure it aligns with our repositoryâ€™s policy.
