# Policy

## Basic Requirements for Paper Submissions {-}

The EcoEvoRxiv server publishes preprints, postprints, reports, and data papers that contribute to the understanding of and advances in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Conservation Biology, and related fields. EcoEvoRxiv welcomes manuscripts based on empirical and simulation data, as well as literature reviews, theory, and opinion, perspective, and comment pieces.

EcoEvoRxiv hosts manuscripts:
Written in English, Spanish,  Portuguese, and French
Of high quality with regard to structure, data presentation, and validity of conclusions
From the scientific disciplines of Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Conservation Biology, or related fields.
Containing a title, author name(s) and affiliation(s)
Providing details of  correspondence for at least one author
Free from personal attacks
Manuscripts will not be hosted when violations of these policies are detected.

Empirical and theoretical manuscripts will be assessed by at least one editorial member to decide whether to accept or reject the manuscript, whereas an opinion or review article may be assessed by two or more members.

For postprints, it is the authors’ responsibility to connect their postprint to the published version of the article and ensure that the postprint adheres to the publisher’s copyright and self-archiving policy. Publisher policies on self-archiving of preprints and postprints can be found on the Sherpa-Romeo webpage.

Note that preprints can be withdrawn if serious issues with a manuscript are identified after the preprint has been published. For example, EcoEvoRxiv reserves the right to withdraw a preprint if requested by the authors (e.g., due to significant errors or omissions), in the event of conflicts among authors or third parties (e.g., disagreement on authorship or data ownership), or in instances where there is evidence of scientific misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, data fabrication or falsification). Preprints can be resubmitted if errors are corrected and/or conflicts resolved.
EcoEvoRxiv may update this publication policy at any time.
