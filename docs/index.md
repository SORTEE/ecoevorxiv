# Welcome to EcoEvoRxiv!

EcoEvoRxiv ("eco-evo-archive") is a not-for-profit subject-matter specific research repository for works related to ecology, evolution, conservation, and related fields. The archived works can be empirical, theoretical, reviews or of any other research-related type.

The EcoEvoRxiv server can be used for freely and legally sharing preprints, postprints, reports, and datasets.
For more information about preprints and preprint servers, please see our [FAQ page](FAQ). 

EcoEvoRxiv started as part of the Transparency in Ecology and Evolution (TEE) movement in 2018, and was originally hosted by the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). In October of 2022 the EcoEvoRxiv server [transitioned](https://cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2022/10/19/ecoevorxiv-partners-with-california-digital-library-to-re-launch-preprint-service-on-janeway/) to being hosted by the [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org/services/pad/escholarship/), and EcoEvoRxiv became an official preprint server of the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology](http://www.sortee.org/) (SORTEE).


## Why use a pre-print server?

#### They’re quick! {.unnumbered}

Preprints are a way of disseminating your findings before a long [peer-reviewed process](https://www.nature.com/articles/530148a). This means your work won’t be out of date by the time people read it. 
  
#### Open access {.unnumbered}

Your work can reach researchers and others who do not have access to pay walled publications.    

#### Improved science {.unnumbered}

Once you’ve posted a preprint, other researchers may offer feedback on it via email or social media.It is a chance to catch mistakes, improve clarity and grow, before it’s committed to publication.   

#### Citations {.unnumbered}

Preprints can be cited, and can be used to establish precedence of your work.
