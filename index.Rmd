# Welcome to EcoEvoRxiv!

EcoEvoRxiv is an open-access pre-print server for ecological and evolutionary research. Our goal is to facilitate researchers sharing their findings before formal publication by providing a platform for cutting-edge research in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.     

## Why use a pre-print server?

#### They’re quick!

Preprints are a way of disseminating your findings before a long [peer-reviewed process](https://www.nature.com/articles/530148a). This means your work won’t be out of date by the time people read it. 
  
#### Open access

Your work can reach researchers and others who do not have access to pay walled publications.    

#### Improved science

Once you’ve posted a preprint, other researchers may offer feedback on it via email or social media.It is a chance to catch mistakes, improve clarity and grow, before it’s committed to publication.   

#### Citations

Preprints can be cited, and can be used to establish precedence of your work.
