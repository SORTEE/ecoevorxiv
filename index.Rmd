# Welcome to EcoEvoRxiv! {-}

<summary style=font-size:18px> EcoEvoRxiv is an open-access pre-print server for ecological and evolutionary research. Our goal is to facilitate researchers sharing their findings before formal publication by providing a platform for cutting-edge research in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. </summary>    

# Why use a pre-print server? {-}

#### They’re quick!
  <summary style=font-size:14px> Preprints are a way of disseminating your findings before a long [peer-reviewed process](https://www.nature.com/articles/530148a). This means your work won’t be out of date by the time people read it. </summary>
  
#### Open access
  <summary style=font-size:14px> Your work can reach researchers and others who do not have access to pay walled publications. </summary>   

#### Improved science
  <summary style=font-size:14px> Once you’ve posted a preprint, other researchers may offer feedback on it via email or social media.It is a chance to catch mistakes, improve clarity and grow, before it’s committed to publication. </summary>  

#### Citations 
  <summary style=font-size:14px> Preprints can be cited, and can be used to establish precedence of your work. </summary>
